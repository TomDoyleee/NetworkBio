# Ecology

      Networks can be used to describe food chains in an ecosystem. Can be used to help identify key species in a food chain to help manage habitats.

      Fig 1. Food Web Network. This is an example of a directed network.

# Pathways

      Another directed network in biology is that of molecular pathways. These pathways are a series of actions between molecules within a cell that lead to a specific outcome. That can be switching genes on or off and making other molecules such as proteins.
      These pathways often interact with each other and can be used to help identify causes of disease, as if one part of the pathway fails, it often leads to a cascade of problems within that cell.
