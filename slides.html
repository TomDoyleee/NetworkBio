# Types of Biology Networks

# Ecology

      Networks can be used to describe food chains in an ecosystem, with different species 
      represented as nodes and direct edges representing 'is eaten by'. Can be used to help 
      identify key species in a food chain to help manage habitats.

      Fig 1. Food Web Network. This is an example of a directed network.

# Metabolic networks
      These networks represent the biochemical reactions that allow organisms to grow, 
      reproduce and respond to evironmental stimuli. Enzymes and Metabolites are represented 
      as nodes and the reactions that cause their transformations are represented by 
      directed edges.

# Cell Signalling Pathways

      Another directed network in biology is that of cell signalling pathways. These pathways 
      are a series of actions between molecules within a cell that control cellular activities.
      That can be switching genes on or off and making other molecules such as proteins.
      These pathways often interact with each other and can be used to help identify causes of 
      disease, as if one part of the pathway fails, it often leads to a cascade of problems 
      within that cell e.g. cancer.

# Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks
      PPI networks are represented as undirected networks, with proteins represented as nodes 
      and edges are the relationships between them. These relationships are vital to practically 
      every process that takes place in a cell, so understanding them is key to analysing 
      cellular functions.
