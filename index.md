### 2. Biological Networks
Networks have many different uses in biology. They can be used to represent interactions and relationships between groups and individual objects. These can range from relationships between species or interactions between molecules.

### 3. STRING database 
STRING is a database than can be used to map predicted associations between proteins. These can be physical interactions, with experimental data confirming these interactions, or text mined from publications, were proteins are mentioned consistantly together in papers, generating a higher confidence score. 

Use the [link](String/string.html) to query your own choice of protein, e.g NOD2 or TNF.


### 4. Network Analysis
Once you have generated a network with a set of candidate genes, you can carry out a variety of anaylsis methods. 

Other data can be integrated with these networks such as gene expression data or gene pathogencitiy scores to help identify
